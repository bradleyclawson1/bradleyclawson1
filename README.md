Add IPs to your GitHub organization
If you have restricted access to the GitHub organization assets by configuring an allow list, add the IP addresses for the DevOps Center app.

Check out this link for managing allowed IP addresses for your GitHub organization.

Add these IP addresses to your GitHub organization’s allow list:
52.43.33.118
44.230.180.227
44.225.154.211
100.21.209.24
Add the Salesforce IP address ranges for the org’s region. See Salesforce IP Addresses and Domains to Allow.
